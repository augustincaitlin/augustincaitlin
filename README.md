👋  &nbsp; Hi, I’m @augustincaitlin

👀  &nbsp; I’m interested in building open source data products to allow more organizations and individuals benefit from the power of data science & data engineering.

💞️ &nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate on tools that can help public interest / third sector groups do their work more efficently as part of my work with [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/)

🌱 &nbsp; I’m currently learning about synthetic data and building synthetic datasets for population modeling. I'm currently expanding my skills in this arena as a member of Cohort 4 of[Open Life Science](http://openlifesci.org)

🌼  &nbsp; I'm an organizer of the [Orlando Lady Devs](https://orlandoladydevelopers.com/) and I'd love to see you in our community!

📫  &nbsp; How to reach me - tweet at me [@augustincaitlin](https://twitter.com/augustincaitlin) or email augustincaitlin@gmail.com
