- 👋   Hi, I’m @augustincaitlin
- 👀   I’m interested in building open source data products to allow more organizations and individuals benefit from the power of data science & data engineering.
- 💞️   I’m looking to collaborate on tools that can help public interest / third sector groups do their work more efficently as part of my work with [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/)
- 🌱   I’m currently learning about synthetic data and building synthetic datasets for population modeling. I'm currently expanding my skills in this arena as a member of Cohort 4 of[Open Life Science](http://openlifesci.org)
- 🌼   I'm an organizer of the [Orlando Lady Devs](https://orlandoladydevelopers.com/) and I'd love to see you in our community!
