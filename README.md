👋  &nbsp; Hi, I’m @augustincaitlin

👀  &nbsp; I’m interested in building open source data products to allow more organizations and individuals benefit from the power of data science & data engineering.

💞️ &nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate on tools that can help public interest / third sector groups do their work more efficently as part of my work with [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/)

📫  &nbsp; How to reach me - tweet at me [@augustincaitlin](https://twitter.com/augustincaitlin) or email augustincaitlin@gmail.com
